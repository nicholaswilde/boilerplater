Description

## Installation

## Usage

## Pre-commit hook

If you want to automatically generate `README.md` files with a pre-commit hook, make sure you
[install the pre-commit binary](https://pre-commit.com/#install), and add a [.pre-commit-config.yaml file](./.pre-commit-config.yaml)
to your project. Then run:

```bash
$ pre-commit install
$ pre-commit install-hooks
```
Currently, this only works on `amd64` systems.
